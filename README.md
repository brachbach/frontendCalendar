This was an interesting challenge! I feel that I was making steady progress and had a pretty clear sense of where to go next, and simply ran out of time to implement everything that I wanted to implement. 

To run the app, go in your terminal to the folder containing the app and enter 'npm start'

Next items to work on:
-allow paging through the calendar
-eliminate the 'all events' view
-input validation
-refactor creating/editing events to a modal
-make sure that calendar view generates the proper view on the border of months/years (based on how new Date() works, it should, but worth checking)
-accept a wider array of user inputs for dates and times
-refactor event storage to be more performant
-reset event creating and editing upon clicking on the create button or on an event (thought it would be trivial but couldn't get it right away)
-enable events that span multiple days
-small visual upgrades:
  -wrap long words instead of overflowing (not so important)
